    "# Autocast / AMP in PyTorch: A Deep Practical Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "Every neural network is fundamentally a giant mathematical expression, and training is the process of tuning the constants (weights) so that expression approximates reality. We do this by computing a loss, backpropagating to get gradients, and nudging the weights a tiny bit in the right direction. Repeat billions of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we care about this *now*? Because modern deep learning training is GPU-dominated and compute-hungry. Matrix multiplications are embarrassingly parallel, so GPUs can run thousands of tiny operations at once — but as models grow, the cost of training keeps rising. Mixed precision training is one of the highest-leverage efficiency techniques we have: it uses fast low-precision hardware (Tensor Cores / specialized units) where it's safe, while preserving FP32 where training would otherwise become numerically unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here's the thing: those weights and gradients are stored as **floating-point numbers**. And floating-point numbers are *not* real numbers. They are a finite approximation with a specific *resolution*. That resolution depends on the format — FP32, FP16, BF16, TF32, FP8 — and each format makes a different tradeoff between **range** (how large and small the numbers can get) and **precision** (how fine the steps between consecutive representable values are).\n",
    "\n",
    "This matters because during training, we routinely deal with numbers spanning many orders of magnitude: weights around $10^0$, gradients as small as $10^{-8}$, attention logits that can spike to $10^3$, and accumulations over thousands of values. A format that can't represent tiny gradients kills learning (they become zero). A format that can't represent large attention logits kills stability (they become infinity). A format that rounds too aggressively corrupts the running statistics that normalization layers depend on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental question this notebook answers is: **when can we get away with lower resolution, and when does it break training?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Autocast (AMP) is PyTorch's answer: a per-operation precision policy that routes each computation to the right format. Some ops get the speed of 16-bit. Some ops get the safety of 32-bit. The combined effect is faster training with (nearly) no loss in quality. But to understand *when* and *why* AMP works — and to debug it when it doesn't — you need to understand what floating-point formats can and cannot represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's what this notebook is for.\n",

    "### How to read this table\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a floating-point format as a **measuring tape**:\n",
    "- **Exponent bits** determine the **length** of the tape (range: how big/small magnitudes you can reach).\n",
    "- **Mantissa bits** determine how **fine the tick marks** are (precision: how many significant digits you keep).\n",
    "\n",
    "| Format | Range | Precision | Training implication |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|\n",
    "| **FP8** | Very narrow | Very low | Needs careful scaling (per-tensor/per-channel), mostly used with specialized kernels/hardware |\n",
    "| **FP16** | Narrow (5-bit exp) | Moderate (10-bit mantissa) | Underflow risk for gradients, overflow risk for activations → needs **loss scaling** |\n",
    "| **BF16** | Wide (8-bit exp, same as FP32) | Low (7-bit mantissa) | Rarely underflows → usually **no loss scaling** needed, but coarse rounding in reductions |\n",
    "| **FP32** | Wide | High | Stable baseline; slower and more memory |\n",
    "| **TF32** | Wide | Moderate (10-bit mantissa) | Compute-only on Ampere+ GPUs: FP32 matmuls may silently use TF32 for speed |\n",
    "| **FP64** | Very wide | Very high | Mostly for numeric reference/debugging (too slow for large training) |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two immediate consequences:**\n",
    "1. FP16 has more mantissa bits than BF16 → **better precision per value**.\n",
    "2. BF16 has the same exponent width as FP32 → **dramatically better range** than FP16.\n",
    "\n",
    "So: FP16 fails first due to **range** (underflow/overflow). BF16 fails first due to **precision** (rounding/accumulation error). FP8 fails due to both unless extra care is taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autocast exists to route computations so that you get the performance of 16-bit compute without the worst numeric failure modes."

    "**TF32 (TensorFloat-32)** is an NVIDIA format introduced with the Ampere architecture (A100, 2020). It is *not* a storage format — you never create a TF32 tensor. Instead, Tensor Cores silently use TF32 arithmetic when you run FP32 matmuls on Ampere+ GPUs.\n",

    "- Non-matmul ops (LayerNorm, softmax, element-wise) still use full FP32 precision.\n",
    "- This is actually a reasonable default: matmuls with FP32 accumulation tolerate reduced input precision well, and TF32 is ~8× faster than strict FP32 on Tensor Cores.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 1.1.10 Tensor Core mechanics: why mixed precision is fast\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern GPU speedups from mixed precision come from **Tensor Cores** — specialized hardware units that perform tile-based matrix-multiply-accumulate (MMA) operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Tensor Cores work:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tile-based:** Tensor Cores operate on small tiles (e.g., 16×16×16 for FP16 on Volta/Turing, 16×8×16 on Ampere). The GPU's warp scheduler feeds tiles from the input matrices to Tensor Cores.\n",
    "2. **Mixed-precision accumulation:** Inputs are FP16/BF16 (or TF32/FP8), but the **accumulation** (partial sums) happens in **FP32**. This is why matmuls under autocast are both fast *and* numerically reasonable.\n",
    "3. **Result:** $D = A \\times B + C$ where $A$, $B$ are low-precision and $C$, $D$ are FP32 accumulators.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dimension alignment matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensor Cores achieve maximum throughput when matrix dimensions are **multiples of 8** (for FP16/BF16) or **multiples of 16** (for FP8/INT8). Misaligned dimensions force the GPU to pad or fall back to slower CUDA cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why you'll see guidance like:\n",
    "- Embedding dimensions: use multiples of 64 or 128\n",
    "- Vocabulary size: pad to a multiple of 8\n",
    "- Batch size: prefer multiples of 8\n",

    "\n",
    "This is the foundational paper for everything in this notebook. It introduced the three-part recipe that all modern AMP implementations are based on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem:** FP16 arithmetic is fast (2–8$\\times$ throughput on Tensor Cores) and memory-efficient (half the bytes), but naively training in FP16 breaks. Models either diverge, produce NaN losses, or silently stagnate. The paper identifies three distinct failure modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Weight update stagnation.** When a weight $w$ is stored in FP16, the update $\\Delta w = \\eta \\cdot g$ can be smaller than the ULP (unit in the last place) at $|w|$. The update is rounded away and the weight never changes. The paper's solution: maintain an FP32 \"master copy\" of all parameters. Forward and backward compute use the FP16 cast, but the actual parameter update happens in FP32 where the precision is sufficient to register small changes. The updated FP32 value is then cast back to FP16 for the next forward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gradient underflow.** Even with FP32 master weights, gradients themselves are computed in FP16 during the backward pass. FP16's smallest normalized number is approximately $6 \\times 10^{-5}$. The paper's analysis of gradient histograms across several production models (image classifiers, speech models, generative models) shows that a significant fraction of gradient values fall below this threshold. Once they underflow to zero, the update signal is lost. The solution: **loss scaling**. Multiply the scalar loss by a large constant $S$ before calling `backward()`. Since backpropagation is a chain of multiplications, every gradient in the network is scaled up by $S$. After backward, divide gradients by $S$ before the optimizer step. If $S$ is chosen well, gradients that would have underflowed are now safely within FP16's representable range, and the division by $S$ restores correct magnitudes. The paper demonstrates that a fixed $S$ works for many models, but notes that $S$ too large can cause gradient *overflow*. This motivates **dynamic loss scaling**: start with a large $S$, and if `inf`/`nan` gradients are detected, skip the update and reduce $S$. If training is stable, periodically increase $S$ to maximize headroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Accumulation error in reductions.** Large dot products and reductions (e.g., summing thousands of values) accumulate rounding errors that compound in FP16. The paper recommends performing these accumulations in FP32, even when the operands are FP16. Modern Tensor Cores implement this: they accept FP16 inputs but accumulate in FP32.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to remember:** AMP is not a single trick. It is the *combination* of (a) per-op precision policies, (b) loss scaling, and (c) FP32 master weights/optimizer state. Removing any one of these can cause training to fail."

    "\n",
    "This paper provides the empirical and theoretical justification for BF16 as a training format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key insight** is architectural: BF16 uses **8 exponent bits** (same as FP32), giving it the same dynamic range — roughly $10^{-38}$ to $10^{38}$. This means BF16 can represent the same extreme magnitudes as FP32. The gradient underflow problem that plagues FP16 (5-bit exponent → range only $10^{-5}$ to $6.5 \\times 10^4$) essentially does not exist for BF16.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The tradeoff:** BF16 sacrifices mantissa bits (7 vs FP16's 10 vs FP32's 23). This means worse *precision* per individual value. But the paper demonstrates empirically that deep neural networks are remarkably robust to precision loss — they are much more sensitive to *range* loss. Training with BF16 across a variety of models (ResNets, Transformers, LSTMs) converges to the same final accuracy as FP32, often without any loss scaling at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conversion simplicity:** Since BF16 and FP32 share the same exponent field, conversion is trivial: truncate (or round) the bottom 16 mantissa bits. FP32 → FP16 conversion is harder because the exponent field must also be narrowed, risking overflow or underflow in the conversion itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical implication for AMP:** BF16 autocast is often a \"drop-in\" replacement that doesn't require a `GradScaler`. This is explicitly confirmed by modern frameworks: DeepSpeed documentation states, \"Training with bfloat16 does not require loss scaling.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**When BF16 can still struggle:** Precision-sensitive accumulations (layernorm statistics, attention score normalization, large batch reductions) can still degrade with BF16's 7-bit mantissa. This is why autocast routes these operations to FP32 even in BF16 mode."

    "\n",
    "The key technique from *8-bit Optimizers via Block-wise Quantization*:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Block-wise quantization:** Split each optimizer state tensor (e.g., Adam's $m$ and $v$) into contiguous blocks of **2048 elements**. Each block gets its own normalization constant (the block's absolute maximum), so outliers in one region don't destroy precision for the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic tree quantization:** Instead of uniform quantization (which wastes bins on empty ranges), use a **non-uniform mapping** designed for the actual distribution of optimizer states. Optimizer moments tend to follow heavy-tailed distributions, so more bins are allocated near zero and fewer at the extremes. The mapping is computed via a binary tree structure that adapts to the data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Stable embedding layer:** The embedding layer's optimizer state is particularly sensitive to quantization (sparse updates, high variance). Dettmers et al. propose keeping embedding optimizer states in higher precision or using a stabilized update rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical result:** ~75% memory reduction for optimizer state (from 8 bytes/param down to ~2 bytes/param for the moment buffers) with negligible accuracy loss across a wide range of tasks and model sizes.\n",

    "**`sum`** is a reduction that accumulates values. Summing 20,000 BF16 values can easily exceed the representable range (BF16 max ~ $3.4 \\times 10^{38}$, but even FP16 max is only ~65,504). More critically, the rounding errors from adding many small values compound. PyTorch hardcodes `sum` to promote to FP32.\n",

    "> **Note on BatchNorm (for CNN practitioners):** While our transformer example uses LayerNorm, convolutional architectures typically use **BatchNorm**, which maintains running statistics (`running_mean`, `running_var`) that are updated with an exponential moving average across batches. These running statistics must stay in **FP32** — they are long-lived accumulators that would drift significantly in FP16/BF16. PyTorch's autocast handles this automatically (BatchNorm is on the FP32 \"keep\" list), but if you manually cast your model with `.half()` or `.bfloat16()`, the running statistics will also be cast to low precision, potentially corrupting them over many batches. If you must manually cast, keep normalization layers in FP32: `model.half(); for m in model.modules(): if isinstance(m, (nn.BatchNorm1d, nn.BatchNorm2d, nn.BatchNorm3d)): m.float()`."

    "## 3.8 Interpreting results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss curves\n",
    "- **FP32**: should decrease smoothly. This is your reference.\n",
    "- **FP16 naive**: may diverge, stagnate, or produce NaN. This demonstrates why casting everything to half precision is not safe.\n",
    "- **BF16 naive**: often converges to a similar loss as FP32. This is the dramatic proof that BF16's range (8-bit exponent) matters more than FP16's precision (10-bit mantissa) for training stability. The network tolerates noisy gradient values; it cannot tolerate zero gradient values.\n",
    "- **AMP FP16 (no scaler)**: may work but may show more zero gradients than the scaled version. This shows that autocast alone helps (per-op policy keeps sensitive ops in FP32) but doesn't fully solve the backward-pass underflow problem.\n",
    "- **AMP FP16 (with scaler)**: should be stable. The GradScaler rescues gradients from underflow.\n",
    "- **AMP BF16**: typically matches FP32 quality without needing a scaler.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step time\n",
    "- On modern GPUs, AMP often reduces step time because matmuls hit Tensor Cores.\n",
    "- If you don't see speedup: model may be too small (overhead dominates), or you're CPU-bound.\n",
    "- The smallest models sometimes see AMP *overhead* because the per-op dispatch cost exceeds the Tensor Core gains. This goes away at realistic model sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient norms\n",
    "- Should be comparable across regimes for a well-behaved model.\n",
    "- If FP16 naive shows erratic norms, that's the underflow/overflow instability.\n",
    "- BF16 naive norms should be close to FP32 (same gradient magnitudes, just represented with fewer mantissa bits).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Zero gradients\n",
    "- A high `zero_grad_frac` indicates underflow or dead signal (exact zeros).\n",
    "- **FP16 naive** and **AMP FP16 no scaler** may show elevated zero-gradient fractions.\n",
    "- **BF16 naive** should show low zero-gradient fractions (gradients don't underflow with 8-bit exponent).\n",
    "- The difference between FP16+scaler and FP16 without scaler directly measures the benefit of loss scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GradScaler scale\n",
    "- If scale drops repeatedly, the model is hitting overflow events and GradScaler is skipping steps.\n",
    "- If scale grows steadily, training is stable and GradScaler is increasing headroom.\n",
    "- A \"spiky\" pattern (rapid drops followed by slow climbs) is normal and expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory\n",
    "- AMP typically uses ~same or slightly more memory than FP32 for parameters+optimizer (due to master weights), but saves on activations.\n",
    "- Naive 16-bit uses less total memory but trades stability.\n",
    "- The savings become dramatic at larger batch sizes and sequence lengths.\n",
    "- At LLM scale with Adam: 16 bytes/param (mixed precision) vs 16 bytes/param (FP32). The *activation* memory savings are where AMP really wins."

    "## 3.9 Practical checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defaults that usually work\n",
    "- **CUDA:** prefer **BF16 autocast** if your GPU supports it (Ampere+). No GradScaler needed.\n",
    "- **CUDA (no BF16):** use **FP16 autocast + GradScaler**.\n",
    "- **CPU:** use **BF16 autocast** (mostly for numerics; speedups depend on CPU/kernel support).\n",
    "- **MPS:** use **FP16 autocast** (operator coverage differs from CUDA; verify with probes in Section 3).\n",
    "- Keep optimizer state in FP32 (default for most PyTorch optimizers).\n",
    "\n",
    "### When things go wrong\n",
    "1. **Loss becomes `nan`/`inf`:** Check for overflow sources (attention logits, exp/log, unstable loss). Consider lowering learning rate or adding gradient clipping.\n",
    "2. **Gradients mostly zero in FP16:** Use GradScaler with higher initial scale. Consider switching to BF16.\n",
    "3. **Training \"does nothing\":** Check for weight update stagnation — are weights actually changing? Ensure you have FP32 master weights (standard when model is FP32 + autocast).\n",
    "4. **Unexplained dtype behavior:** Use dtype hooks (Section 3.3) to confirm what's running in what dtype.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common gotchas\n",
    "- Mixing manual `.half()` casts with autocast can lead to unexpected behavior.\n",
    "- Gradient clipping should happen **after** `scaler.unscale_(optimizer)`.\n",
    "- `autocast` should cover forward + loss, but **not** the optimizer step.\n",
    "- Be careful with `out=` tensors and in-place ops: autocast does not rewrite an `out=` buffer’s dtype, and in-place ops can't change dtype.\n",
    "- Autocast has an internal cast cache (weight-cast reuse). If you see weird memory growth or do unusual in-place weight mutation, try `cache_enabled=False`.\n",
    "- On Ampere+ GPUs, your \"FP32 baseline\" may use TF32 for matmuls. Check `torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32`."

    "- **Autocast cast cache:** CUDA autocast caches some casts (especially weight casts) for speed. This is usually what you want. If you do unusual in-place weight mutation inside autocast regions or see unexpected memory behavior, try `cache_enabled=False`.\n",
